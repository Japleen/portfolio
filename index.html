        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm always trying to find a good balance in life, making sure I'm healthy and happy while I work. I really
            believe in taking care of myself and my loved ones, like eating well and keeping clean. It's important for me to feel good
            inside and out, so I spend time on things like eating right and looking after myself and my loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            By profession, I'm a coder, working with technology every day. But I'm also an artist at heart. I love to
            dance when I'm happy, listen to music when I'm feeling emotional, paint when I'm feeling creative, and write to
            share my thoughts with others. I'm always trying to make the world a better place in my own way.
