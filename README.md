Greetings,

                I am a passionate individual driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence and attention to detail in every endeavor. 
                My journey, anchored in mechanical engineering with a specialized experience on the structure and design of naval ships, has equipped me with a robust foundation in precision engineering and technical prowess.
